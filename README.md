> **Note**: We have moved `aspen` to the Passerine monorepo, [which can be found here](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine). As a result, this repository is out of date and has been archived.

# aspen
Passerine's package manager.

## Getting Started
To install the `aspen` command, run this in the shell of your choice:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSf https://www.passerine.io/install.sh)
```

> **Note**: The above shell script no longer works. We recommend you use this instead:
> ```
> cargo install passerine-aspen
> ```

This requires git and a recent version of Cargo to work.
You can inspect the contents of `install.sh` first if you want,
we're not trying to play any tricks on you.

2. Start a new Passerine project using Aspen:
```bash
aspen new example
```
3. This will create a project named `example` in the current directory.
   Open this project and look through it in your editor of choice.
4. To run the project:
```bash
cd example
aspen run
```

> `aspen run` and most other commands optionally take a path to the project root.
